Description:
		The STM32 ADC can be configured to use external trigger sources
		(e.g. timers, pwm or exti gpio). Then, it can be tuned to start
		conversions on external trigger by either:
<<<<<<< HEAD
		- "rising-edge"
		- "falling-edge"
		- "both-edges".
		Reading returns current trigger polarity.
=======

		- "rising-edge"
		- "falling-edge"
		- "both-edges".

		Reading returns current trigger polarity.

>>>>>>> upstream/android-13
		Writing value before enabling conversions sets trigger polarity.
