Description:
		The GNSS receiver type. The currently identified types reflect
		the protocol(s) supported by the receiver:

<<<<<<< HEAD
			"NMEA"		NMEA 0183
			"SiRF"		SiRF Binary
			"UBX"		UBX
=======
			======		===========
			"NMEA"		NMEA 0183
			"SiRF"		SiRF Binary
			"UBX"		UBX
			======		===========
>>>>>>> upstream/android-13

		Note that also non-"NMEA" type receivers typically support a
		subset of NMEA 0183 with vendor extensions (e.g. to allow
		switching to a vendor protocol).
