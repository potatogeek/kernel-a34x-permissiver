		This is mandatory if DFSDM is slave on SPI bus, to
		provide information on the SPI clock frequency during runtime
		Notice that the SPI frequency should be a multiple of sample
		frequency to ensure the precision.

		if DFSDM input is SPI master
			Reading  SPI clkout frequency,
			error on writing
		If DFSDM input is SPI Slave:
			Reading returns value previously set.
			Writing value before starting conversions.
