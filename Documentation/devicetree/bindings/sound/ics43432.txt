Invensense ICS-43432 MEMS microphone with I2S output.
=======
Invensense ICS-43432-compatible MEMS microphone with I2S output.
>>>>>>> upstream/android-13

There are no software configuration options for this device, indeed, the only
host connection is the I2S interface. Apart from requirements on clock
frequency (460 kHz to 3.379 MHz according to the data sheet) there must be
64 clock cycles in each stereo output frame; 24 of the 32 available bits
contain audio data. A hardware pin determines if the device outputs data
on the left or right channel of the I2S frame.

Required properties:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - compatible : Must be "invensense,ics43432"
=======
  - compatible: should be one of the following.
     "invensense,ics43432": For the Invensense ICS43432
     "cui,cmm-4030d-261": For the CUI CMM-4030D-261-I2S-TR

Example:

	ics43432: ics43432 {
		compatible = "invensense,ics43432";
	};
