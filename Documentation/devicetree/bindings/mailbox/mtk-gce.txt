MediaTek GCE
===============

The Global Command Engine (GCE) is used to help read/write registers with
critical time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
vblank. The GCE can be used to implement the Command Queue (CMDQ) driver.

CMDQ driver uses mailbox framework for communication. Please refer to
mailbox.txt for generic information about mailbox device-tree bindings.

Required properties:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- compatible: Can be one of the following strings:
	"mediatek,mt6779-gce" for mt6799.
	"mediatek,mt8173-gce" for mt8173.
	"mediatek,mt2712-gce", "mediatek,mt8173-gce" for mt2712.
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- #mbox-cells: Should be 3.
	<&phandle channel priority atomic_exec>
	phandle: Label name of a gce node.
	channel: Channel of mailbox. Be equal to the thread id of GCE.
	priority: Priority of GCE thread.
	atomic_exec: GCE processing continuous packets of commands in atomic
		way.
Optional properties:
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock
=======
- compatible: can be "mediatek,mt8173-gce", "mediatek,mt8183-gce",
  "mediatek,mt8192-gce", "mediatek,mt8195-gce" or "mediatek,mt6779-gce".
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock
- #mbox-cells: Should be 2.
	<&phandle channel priority>
	phandle: Label name of a gce node.
	channel: Channel of mailbox. Be equal to the thread id of GCE.
	priority: Priority of GCE thread.

Required properties for a client device:
- mboxes: Client use mailbox to communicate with GCE, it should have this
  property and list of phandle, mailbox specifiers.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- mediatek,gce-subsys: u32, specify the sub-system id which is corresponding
  to the register address.

Some vaules of properties are defined in 'dt-bindings/gce/mtxxxx-gce.h', e.g.,
mt8173-gce.h. Such as sub-system ids, thread priority, event ids.

Optional properties for a client device:
- mediatek,gce-client-reg: Specify the sub-system id which is corresponding
  to the register address, it should have this property and list of phandle,
  sub-system specifiers.
  <&phandle subsys_number start_offset size>
  phandle: Label name of a gce node.
  subsys_number: specify the sub-system id which is corresponding
                 to the register address.
  start_offset: the start offset of register address that GCE can access.
  size: the total size of register address that GCE can access.

Optional properties for a client mutex node:
- mediatek,gce-events: GCE events used by clients. The event numbers are
  defined in 'dt-bindings/gce/<chip>-gce.h'.

Some vaules of properties are defined in 'dt-bindings/gce/mt8173-gce.h',
'dt-binding/gce/mt8183-gce.h', 'dt-binding/gce/mt8192-gce.h',
'dt-binding/gce/mt8195-gce.h' or 'dt-bindings/gce/mt6779-gce.h'.
Such as sub-system ids, thread priority, event ids.
