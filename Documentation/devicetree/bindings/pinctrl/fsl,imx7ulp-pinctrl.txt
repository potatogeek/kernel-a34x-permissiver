* Freescale i.MX7ULP IOMUX Controller

i.MX 7ULP has three IOMUXC instances: IOMUXC0 for M4 ports, IOMUXC1 for A7
ports and IOMUXC DDR for DDR interface.

Note:
This binding doc is only for the IOMUXC1 support in A7 Domain and it only
supports generic pin config.

Please also refer pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for generic pinctrl
binding.

=== Pin Controller Node ===

Required properties:
- compatible:	"fsl,imx7ulp-iomuxc1"
- reg:		Should contain the base physical address and size of the iomuxc
		registers.

=== Pin Configuration Node ===
- pinmux: One integers array, represents a group of pins mux setting.
	The format is pinmux = <PIN_FUNC_ID>, PIN_FUNC_ID is a pin working on
	a specific function.

	NOTE: i.MX7ULP PIN_FUNC_ID consists of 4 integers as it shares one mux
	and config register as follows:
	<mux_conf_reg input_reg mux_mode input_val>

	Refer to imx7ulp-pinfunc.h in in device tree source folder for all
	available imx7ulp PIN_FUNC_ID.

Optional Properties:
- drive-strength		Integer. Controls Drive Strength
					0: Standard
					1: Hi Driver
- drive-push-pull		Bool. Enable Pin Push-pull
- drive-open-drain		Bool. Enable Pin Open-drian
- slew-rate:			Integer. Controls Slew Rate
					0: Standard
					1: Slow
- bias-disable:			Bool. Pull disabled
- bias-pull-down:		Bool. Pull down on pin
- bias-pull-up:			Bool. Pull up on pin
=======
Please refer to fsl,imx-pinctrl.txt in this directory for common binding
part and usage.

Required properties:
- compatible:	"fsl,imx7ulp-iomuxc1".
- fsl,pins:	Each entry consists of 5 integers which represents the mux
		and config setting for one pin. The first 4 integers
		<mux_conf_reg input_reg mux_mode input_val> are specified
		using a PIN_FUNC_ID macro, which can be found in
		imx7ulp-pinfunc.h in the device tree source folder.
		The last integer CONFIG is the pad setting value like
		pull-up on this pin.

		Please refer to i.MX7ULP Reference Manual for detailed
		CONFIG settings.

PAD_CTL_IBE		(1 << 16)
PAD_CTL_LK		(1 << 16)
PAD_CTL_DSE_HI		(1 << 6)
