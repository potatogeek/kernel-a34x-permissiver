Samsung Exynos SoC USB controller

The USB devices interface with USB controllers on Exynos SOCs.
The device node has following properties.

EHCI
Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "samsung,exynos4210-ehci" for USB 2.0
   EHCI controller in host mode.
 - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
   region.
 - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
 - clocks: from common clock binding: handle to usb clock.
 - clock-names: from common clock binding: Shall be "usbhost".
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - port: if in the SoC there are EHCI phys, they should be listed here.
   One phy per port. Each port should have following entries:
	- reg: port number on EHCI controller, e.g
	       On Exynos5250, port 0 is USB2.0 otg phy
			      port 1 is HSIC phy0
			      port 2 is HSIC phy1
	- phys: from the *Generic PHY* bindings; specifying phy used by port.
=======
 - phys: from the *Generic PHY* bindings; array specifying phy(s) used
   by the root port.
 - phy-names: from the *Generic PHY* bindings; array of the names for
   each phy for the root ports, must be a subset of the following:
   "host", "hsic0", "hsic1".
>>>>>>> upstream/android-13

Optional properties:
 - samsung,vbus-gpio:  if present, specifies the GPIO that
   needs to be pulled up for the bus to be powered.

Example:

	usb@12110000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-ehci";
		reg = <0x12110000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 71 0>;
		samsung,vbus-gpio = <&gpx2 6 1 3 3>;

		clocks = <&clock 285>;
		clock-names = "usbhost";

<<<<<<< HEAD
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		port@0 {
		    reg = <0>;
		    phys = <&usb2phy 1>;
		};
=======
		phys = <&usb2phy 1>;
		phy-names = "host";
>>>>>>> upstream/android-13
	};

OHCI
Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "samsung,exynos4210-ohci" for USB 2.0
   OHCI companion controller in host mode.
 - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
   region.
 - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
 - clocks: from common clock binding: handle to usb clock.
 - clock-names: from common clock binding: Shall be "usbhost".

		interrupts = <0 71 0>;

		clocks = <&clock 285>;
		clock-names = "usbhost";

	};

DWC3
Required properties:
 - compatible: should be one of the following -
	       "samsung,exynos5250-dwusb3": for USB 3.0 DWC3 controller on
					    Exynos5250/5420.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
	       "samsung,exynos5433-dwusb3": for USB 3.0 DWC3 controller on
					    Exynos5433.
>>>>>>> upstream/android-13
	       "samsung,exynos7-dwusb3": for USB 3.0 DWC3 controller on Exynos7.
 - #address-cells, #size-cells : should be '1' if the device has sub-nodes
				 with 'reg' property.
 - ranges: allows valid 1:1 translation between child's address space and
	   parent's address space
 - clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - clock-names: names of clocks correseponding to IDs in the clock property
=======
 - clock-names: Names of clocks corresponding to IDs in the clock property.
                Following clock names shall be provided for different
                compatibles:
                 - samsung,exynos5250-dwusb3: "usbdrd30",
