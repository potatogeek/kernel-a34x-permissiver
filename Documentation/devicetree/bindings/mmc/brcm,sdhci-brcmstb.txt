* BROADCOM BRCMSTB/BMIPS SDHCI Controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-brcmstb driver.

NOTE: The driver disables all UHS speed modes by default and depends
on Device Tree properties to enable them for SoC/Board combinations
that support them.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following
  - "brcm,bcm7425-sdhci"
  - "brcm,bcm7445-sdhci"
<<<<<<< HEAD

  - "brcm,bcm7216-sdhci"

Refer to clocks/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer properties.

Example:
