LogicoreIP designed compatible with Xilinx ZYNQ family.
-------------------------------------------------------

General concept
---------------

LogicoreIP design to provide the isolation between processing system
and programmable logic. Also provides the list of register set to configure
the frequency.

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of:
	"xlnx,vcu"
	"xlnx,vcu-logicoreip-1.0"
<<<<<<< HEAD
- reg, reg-names: There are two sets of registers need to provide.
	1. vcu slcr
	2. Logicore
	reg-names should contain name for the each register sequence.
=======
- reg : The base offset and size of the VCU_PL_SLCR register space.
>>>>>>> upstream/android-13
- clocks: phandle for aclk and pll_ref clocksource
- clock-names: The identification string, "aclk", is always required for
   the axi clock. "pll_ref" is required for pll.
Example:

	xlnx_vcu: vcu@a0040000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,vcu-logicoreip-1.0";
<<<<<<< HEAD
		reg = <0x0 0xa0040000 0x0 0x1000>,
			 <0x0 0xa0041000 0x0 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "vcu_slcr", "logicore";
=======
		reg = <0x0 0xa0040000 0x0 0x1000>;
>>>>>>> upstream/android-13
		clocks = <&si570_1>, <&clkc 71>;
		clock-names = "pll_ref", "aclk";
	};
