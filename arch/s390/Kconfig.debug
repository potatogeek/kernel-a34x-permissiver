	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to show the kernel pagetable layout in a
	  debugfs file. This information is only useful for kernel developers
	  who are working in architecture specific areas of the kernel.
	  It is probably not a good idea to enable this feature in a production
	  kernel.
	  If in doubt, say "N"

config DEBUG_ENTRY
	bool "Debug low-level entry code"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option enables sanity checks in s390 low-level entry code.
	  Some of these sanity checks may slow down kernel entries and
	  exits or otherwise impact performance.

	  If unsure, say N.

config CIO_INJECT
       bool "CIO Inject interfaces"
       depends on DEBUG_KERNEL && DEBUG_FS
       help
	This option provides a debugging facility to inject certain artificial events
	and instruction responses to the CIO layer of Linux kernel. The newly created
	debugfs user-interfaces will be at /sys/kernel/debug/s390/cio/*
