	help
	  Any files read through the kernel file reading interface
	  (kernel modules, firmware, kexec images, security policy)
	  can be pinned to the first filesystem used for loading. When
	  enabled, any files that come from other filesystems will be
	  rejected. This is best used on systems without an initrd that
	  have a root filesystem backed by a read-only device such as
	  dm-verity or a CDROM.
