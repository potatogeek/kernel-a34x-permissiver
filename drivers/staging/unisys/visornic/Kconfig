	The Unisys Visornic driver provides support for s-Par network
	devices exposed on the s-Par visorbus. When a message is sent
	to visorbus to create a network device, the probe function of
	visornic is called to create the netdev device. Networking on
	s-Par switches will not work if this driver is not selected.
	If you say Y here, you will enable the Unisys visornic driver.
