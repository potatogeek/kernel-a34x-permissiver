	The "Communication CPU to Application CPU Interface" (CAIF) is a packet
	based connection-oriented MUX protocol developed by ST-Ericsson for use
	with its modems. It is accessed from user space as sockets (PF_CAIF).

	Say Y (or M) here if you build for a phone product (e.g. Android or

	MeeGo ) that uses CAIF as transport, if unsure say N.

	If you select to build it as module then CAIF_NETDEV also needs to be
	built as modules. You will also need to say yes to any CAIF physical
	devices that your platform requires.
