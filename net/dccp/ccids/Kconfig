	  CCID-3 denotes TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), an equation-based
	  rate-controlled congestion control mechanism.  TFRC is designed to
	  be reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP-like flows,
	  where a flow is "reasonably fair" if its sending rate is generally
	  within a factor of two of the sending rate of a TCP flow under the
	  same conditions.  However, TFRC has a much lower variation of
	  throughput over time compared with TCP, which makes CCID-3 more
	  suitable than CCID-2 for applications such streaming media where a
	  relatively smooth sending rate is of importance.

	  CCID-3 is further described in RFC 4342,

	  The TFRC congestion control algorithms were initially described in
	  RFC 5348.
