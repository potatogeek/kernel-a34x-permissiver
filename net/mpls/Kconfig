	  MultiProtocol Label Switching routes packets through logical
	  circuits.  Originally conceived as a way of routing packets at
	  hardware speeds (before hardware was capable of routing ipv4 packets),
	  MPLS remains a simple way of making tunnels.

	  If you have not heard of MPLS you probably want to say N here.

	 This is helper module to allow segmentation of non-MPLS GSO packets
	 that have had MPLS stack entries pushed onto them and thus
	 become MPLS GSO packets.
