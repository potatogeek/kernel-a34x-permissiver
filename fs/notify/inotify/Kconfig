	  Say Y here to enable inotify support for userspace, including the
	  associated system calls.  Inotify allows monitoring of both files and
	  directories via a single open fd.  Events are read from the file
	  descriptor, which is also select()- and poll()-able.
	  Inotify fixes numerous shortcomings in dnotify and introduces several
	  new features including multiple file events, one-shot support, and
	  unmount notification.
